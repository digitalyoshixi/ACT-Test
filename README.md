# ACT Test
Attention Concentration Test
*name feature and export feature do not work due to lack of time*

Psychology software for a project in data management class

The test is a recreation of Ad van def Ven(https://www.socsci.ru.nl/advdv/)'s article on the same test: https://www.socsci.ru.nl/advdv/engtest.htm

Practice as best you can clicking the red squares from left to right, click the reset button as quick as possible once completed
Making a mistake is ok, just click the reset button immediately.
After 25 rounds, you will be given:
- total # of wins
- your average speed for click all 3 red squares
- your average speed for clicking the reset button after win/loss

Certain rounds may be skipped due to double clicking of the reset button(yes there are a lot of bugs).
These skipped rounds DO NOT impact the final result, but you may have less data to work with in its entirety
